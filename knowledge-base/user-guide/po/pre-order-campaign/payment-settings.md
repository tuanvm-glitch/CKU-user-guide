# Payment Settings

## How to set up

From the campaign wizard, navigate to **Step 2: Payment**. Choose how customers pay for their pre-order.

![Step 2 — Payment Type](https://660775721-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEVi9QELp1WJgWsqrMONK%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-f6935fd37885b43b19bfec9c6070f7a21098fce8%2Fstep2-full-framed.png?alt=media)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Choose payment type

Select one of two payment options:

* **Full payment**: charge the entire product amount when the customer places the pre-order. This is the simplest option — no additional configuration needed.
* **Partial payment (Deposit)**: charge a deposit at checkout and collect the remaining balance later. When selected, additional fields appear (see next steps).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Choose deposit type (when Partial payment is selected)

![Step 2 — Partial payment](https://660775721-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEVi9QELp1WJgWsqrMONK%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-be6c28559a4ffc098fde2c8993d19dc97591541f%2Fstep2-partial-framed.png?alt=media)

* **Percentage**: set a percentage of the product price as the deposit.
* **Fixed amount**: set a fixed dollar amount as the deposit.

Toggle between the two options using the **Percentage** / **Fixed amount** buttons.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Set deposit value (when Partial payment is selected)

* **Deposit percentage (%)**: enter the percentage to charge upfront. Example: `20` means the customer pays 20% now.
* **Deposit amount ($)**: enter the fixed amount to charge upfront (shown when "Fixed amount" is selected). Example: `25` means the customer pays $25 regardless of product price.

{% hint style="success" %}
Tip: A 20–30% deposit is a common practice. It secures the customer's commitment while keeping the entry barrier low.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Set remaining balance schedule (when Partial payment is selected)

Choose when to collect the remaining payment from the customer:

* **On a specific date**: select a date using the **Charge date** picker. The remaining balance will be charged on that date. ◦ Example: `May 01, 2026`
* **Days after checkout**: enter the number of days after the order is placed. The remaining balance is charged automatically. ◦ Example: `30` days after checkout

{% hint style="info" %}
The preview panel updates to show the payment message (e.g., "Pay 20% now, 80% later") when partial payment is configured.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Add order tags (optional)

Type tag names in the **Tags** search field and press Enter to add them. Tags are automatically added to Shopify orders placed through this campaign.

* Click the **×** on a tag to remove it.
* Example tags: `pre-order`, `summer-2026`, `deposit-paid`

{% hint style="success" %}
Tip: Use tags to filter and manage pre-orders in Shopify Admin. For example, create a smart collection or order view filtered by the `pre-order` tag.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Click **Continue** to proceed to [Display Settings](display-settings), or click **Back** to return to [Campaign Settings](campaign-settings).
