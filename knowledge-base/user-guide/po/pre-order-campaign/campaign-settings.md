# Campaign Settings

## How to set up

Navigate to **AOV.ai Pre-Order > Preorders > Create campaign** (or click **Edit** on an existing campaign). The wizard opens on **Step 1: Campaign setting**.

![Step 1 — Campaign Settings](https://660775721-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEVi9QELp1WJgWsqrMONK%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-41ed7e203cc912d59f2c5a1c6c1155d36123a6a1%2Fstep1-preorder-trigger-framed.png?alt=media)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Name your campaign

* **Campaign name**: an internal label to identify this campaign in your admin. Customers will never see this name. ◦ Example: `Summer Pre-Order 2026` or `New Skincare Launch`
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Choose when to show Pre-Order

Below the campaign name, the **When to show Pre-Order** card controls when the Pre-Order button replaces "Add to Cart" on your storefront.

![When to show Pre-Order and Continue Selling](https://660775721-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEVi9QELp1WJgWsqrMONK%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-41ed7e203cc912d59f2c5a1c6c1155d36123a6a1%2Fstep1-preorder-trigger-framed.png?alt=media)

Select a trigger:

* **Out of stock** _(Most common)_ — the Pre-Order button appears only when a product variant's inventory reaches zero. While in stock, customers see "Add to Cart".
* **Always** — the Pre-Order button appears for all products in this campaign, regardless of stock level.

| Trigger          | Product in stock    | Product out of stock |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Out of stock** | Shows "Add to Cart" | Shows "Pre-Order"    |
| **Always**       | Shows "Pre-Order"   | Shows "Pre-Order"    |

{% hint style="info" %}
This setting **cannot be changed while the campaign is active**. Pause the campaign or duplicate it to use a different trigger.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Configure Continue Selling

Below "When to show Pre-Order", the **Continue Selling** card controls how the app manages Shopify's "Continue selling when out of stock" inventory setting.

![Continue Selling settings](https://660775721-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEVi9QELp1WJgWsqrMONK%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-084b10b3e20ac5ebfe400a7c76dfb797a0a3913d%2Fstep1-continue-selling-framed.png?alt=media)

Choose a mode:

* **Automatic** _(Recommended)_ — the app automatically enables "Continue selling when out of stock" for campaign products, and restores the original setting when the campaign ends.
* **Manual** — you manage "Continue selling" yourself in Shopify Admin. The app does not modify inventory policies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you choose **Manual** with the **Out of stock** trigger, make sure "Continue selling when out of stock" is enabled for all campaign products in Shopify Admin. Otherwise customers will see "Sold out" instead of "Pre-Order".
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Tip: Unlike the pre-order trigger, you **can change** the continue selling mode on an active campaign. A confirmation modal will explain the immediate effect.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Add products to the campaign

Click **Add products** to open the Shopify product picker. Select one or more products to include.

The product table shows each added product with:

* **Product name**: linked to the product in Shopify.
* **Inventory**: current stock level — `Out of stock` (red) or `X in stock` (yellow/green).
* **Remove**: click the trash icon to remove a product from the campaign.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a product is included in multiple active campaigns, the most recently created campaign takes priority on the storefront.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Set campaign total limit (optional)

Enable **Set campaign total limit** to restrict the total number of pre-orders that can be placed across all products in this campaign.

* When enabled, enter the maximum number of orders allowed.
* When the limit is reached, the pre-order button will no longer appear for this campaign.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Choose delivery type

![Step 1 — Delivery Date](https://660775721-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEVi9QELp1WJgWsqrMONK%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-dffb9e8819eeb6628f811fd2a38104c53b563346%2Fstep1-delivery-framed.png?alt=media)

Select a **Delivery type** from the dropdown to define when customers can expect their order:

* **Exact date**: pick a specific delivery date using the date picker. ◦ Example: `Apr 10, 2026`
* **Date range**: set a start and end date to show a delivery window. ◦ Example: `Apr 10 – Apr 20, 2026`
* **Relative period**: enter a number of days, weeks, or months from the order date. ◦ Example: `14 days`
* **Relative interval**: enter a min and max range from the order date. ◦ Example: `2–4 weeks`
* **Custom text**: enter any free-form delivery note. ◦ Example: `Ships when available`

{% hint style="success" %}
Tip: Use **Exact date** when you know the precise ship date. Use **Relative period** for delivery that depends on order date. Use **Custom text** for uncertain timelines.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Set delivery date value

Based on your chosen delivery type, fill in the corresponding field:

* **Exact date** → select a date from the date picker.
* **Date range** → select start date and end date.
* **Relative period** → enter a number and select the unit (Days, Weeks, or Months).
* **Relative interval** → enter min value, max value, and select the unit.
* **Custom text** → type your delivery note.

The delivery information is shown to customers on the product page, cart, and order confirmation.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Preview your settings

The **Preview** panel (right side) shows a live preview of how the pre-order button, badge, and messages will appear on your storefront.

* **Product Page**: shows the button, badge, delivery message, and payment message.
* **Collection**: shows the product card with badge overlay.
* **Cart**: shows the cart line item with delivery note.

The preview updates in real-time as you change settings across all three wizard steps.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Click **Continue** to proceed to [Payment Settings](payment-settings).
