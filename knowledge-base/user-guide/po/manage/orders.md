## Overview

Navigate to **AOV.ai Pre-Order > Reports** to access the orders management page.

![Orders report page](https://660775721-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEVi9QELp1WJgWsqrMONK%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-0fe4025da3d8a8ee23a8dee478906a4d643a5685%2Forders-list-framed.png?alt=media)

## How to use

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Review summary metrics

The four cards at the top show a quick snapshot:

* **Total Orders**: total number of pre-orders received.
* **Total Revenue**: combined revenue from all pre-orders.
* **Pending Payment**: orders with outstanding balances (deposit paid, remaining balance due). Shows an "Action needed" badge when count > 0.
* **Fulfilled**: orders that have been shipped or delivered.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Filter orders by status

Use the tab bar to filter:

* **All**: every pre-order regardless of status.
* **Paid**: orders where full payment has been received.
* **Pending Payment**: orders with partial payment — remaining balance is due.
* **Failed**: orders where payment processing failed.
* **Fulfilled**: orders that have been shipped/delivered.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Search for specific orders

Click the **search icon** to find orders by:

* Order number (e.g., `#1020`)
* Customer name
* Customer email
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### View order details

Click any **order number** to open the detail page:

* **Customer info**: name, email, billing and shipping addresses.
* **Products**: line items with product image, variant, quantity, and price.
* **Payment timeline**: chronological record of all payment events.
* **Payment summary**: deposit amount, remaining balance, total, and payment deadlines.
* **Order metadata**: created date, campaign name, tags, and fulfillment status.

Click **View in Shopify** to open the order in Shopify Admin for fulfillment actions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Export orders to CSV

1. Select specific orders using the checkboxes on the left, or leave all unselected to export everything.
2. Click **Export CSV** (top right).
3. A CSV file downloads with order details, customer info, payment status, and fulfillment status.

{% hint style="success" %}
Tip: Export "Pending Payment" orders regularly to follow up on outstanding balances.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Sync data from Shopify

Click **Sync from Shopify** to pull the latest order updates. Use this when:

* Payment status changed in Shopify (e.g., customer paid remaining balance).
* Fulfillment status was updated in Shopify Admin.
* You suspect pre-order data is out of date.

{% hint style="info" %}
The app automatically syncs orders via webhooks. Manual sync is only needed if you notice stale data.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Collect Payment

When a campaign uses **Partial payment**, customers pay a deposit at checkout and the remaining balance is collected later. The **Collect Payment** feature lets you manually trigger payment collection for one or multiple orders.

![Collect payments — select orders and confirm](https://660775721-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FEVi9QELp1WJgWsqrMONK%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-b2b5dda23900be589586b50b487dcb0e9430d091%2Fcollect-payment-framed.png?alt=media)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Select orders to collect

Use the checkboxes on the left to select orders with outstanding balances. You can select individual orders or click **Select all** to select every order on the page.

Once selected, the **Collect payments** button appears at the top of the table.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Confirm and collect

Click **Collect payments** to open the confirmation modal:

* The modal shows how many orders will be processed (e.g., "You're about to collect the remaining balance from **10** preorder(s).").
* **Automatically send invoice if charge fails**: enabled by default. If the charge fails, the customer receives an invoice email with a link to pay manually.
* Customize the invoice email in **Shopify Admin > Settings > Notifications**.

Click **Collect payments** to start processing. Each order is charged using the customer's payment method on file via Shopify.

{% hint style="info" %}
Orders that are already fully paid will be automatically skipped — only orders with remaining balances are processed.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Review results

After collection completes, a toast notification shows the results:

* **Collected**: orders successfully charged.
* **Invoices sent**: invoices sent for failed charges.
* **Failed**: orders where collection failed.
* **Skipped**: orders already paid or with no remaining balance.

{% hint style="success" %}
Tip: After bulk collection, check the **Failed** tab to follow up on orders that couldn't be charged.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
